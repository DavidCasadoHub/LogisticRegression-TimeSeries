# LogisticRegression-TimeSeries

# Time series Summary

1. “OverseasTrips’ is a quarterly time series of overseas trips to Ireland by non-residents from Q1, 2012 to Q4, 2019.
2. ‘NewHouseRegistrations’ is an annual series of new house registrations from 1978 to 2019.

Report:

• An assessment of the components of the raw time series.
• Fit a minimum of three candidate time series models to each. You may wish to consider simple models, exponential smoothing models and non-seasonal and/or seasonal ARIMA models.
• Perform and explain the appropriate diagnostic tests and checks and describe the rationale for your choice of ‘optimum’ model for each series.
• Forecast each series for three periods ahead with appropriate prediction intervals and illustrative graphics and provide your assessment of the adequacy of the chosen model.

# Logistic regression

Choose or create an appropriate dichotomous variable from the data and estimate and report on a suitable binary logistic regression model to classify the cases in respect of the chosen dependent variable.

Report:

* Descriptive statistics and appropriate visualisations to enhance understanding of the variables used.
* Details of the model building steps you undertook in the process of arriving at your final model. Reasons for rejection of intermediate models should be explained clearly.
* Appropriate diagnostics and an assessment of model fit.
* A succinct summary of the parameters of your final model explaining the inclusion and influence of the independent variables.
